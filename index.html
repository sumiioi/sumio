                    <h3>Consistently an honor student.</h3>
                    <p>I was consistently an honor student throughout high school and senior high school, excelling in academics. I was also recognized as a top student in Chemistry and Biology, showcasing my strong analytical and scientific skills.</p>

                    <h3>Arduino-Based Research.</h3>
                    <p>One of my biggest achievements was successfully defending our research titled "Arduino-Based Infrared Sensor with Liquid Crystal Display for Monitoring Comfort Room Usage and Automatic Dispense Cleaning Liquid." This achievement is especially meaningful to me because our team faced significant challenges, as none of us had in-depth knowledge of coding and Arduino at the time. Despite this, we persevered, defended our research, and ultimately won Best Introduction.</p>
